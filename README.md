# Swift on AWS Lambda

This is an experimental project to implement an [AWS Lambda Custom Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html) for [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

To use this runtime to compose a Lambda function, please refer to [SwiftOnLambda-Functions](https://github.com/wqfan/SwiftOnLambda-Functions) for an example.
